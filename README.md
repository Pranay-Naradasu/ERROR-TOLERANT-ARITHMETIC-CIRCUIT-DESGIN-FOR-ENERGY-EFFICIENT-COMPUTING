This project focuses on designing approximate full adders that reduce power, area, and delay while allowing minor accuracy trade-offs. These circuits are ideal for IoT devices, machine learning, and image processing where slight errors do not affect overall performance.

Our proposed design simplifies the logic by modifying existing AFA-3, reducing gate count and achieving ~78% lower power, ~70% smaller area, and ~65% faster speed compared to existing adders. Image processing tests (MSE, PSNR, SSIM) show high-quality results with minimal error.

Results

Area: Reduced by ~70%

Power: Reduced by ~78%

Delay: Reduced by ~65%

PSNR: 38.92 dB | SSIM: 0.791
